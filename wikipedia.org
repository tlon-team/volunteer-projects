#+title: Wikipedia articles

We are occasionally approached by dedicated altruists willing to volunteer their time to translate relevant EA content. Currently, we lack the capacity to integrate volunteer labor into our highly complex workflow. However, we think that volunteers can still make a very valuable contribution to this project /by focusing on Wikipedia articles/. Although translating or (when they already exist in the target language) improving such articles [[https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/FebKgHaAymjiETvXd/wikipedia-editing-is-important-tractable-and-neglected][can have a lot of impact]], we have chosen not to focus on such articles ourselves because Wikipediaâ€™s paid editing policy would require us to disclose each edit, which is a lot of hassle. Non-paid contributors, however, are exempt from this requirement, making the translation or improvement of Wikipedia articles an ideal task for volunteers.

Below, we list several dozen articles relevant form an EA-perspective, grouped by priority. We encourage you to focus on the high-priority articles, though feel free to instead tackle medium- or even low-priority articles if those topics motivate you more or if you disagree with our ranking.

If you never edited Wikipedia before, check out the article in the first paragraph, especially [[https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/FebKgHaAymjiETvXd/wikipedia-editing-is-important-tractable-and-neglected#6__Getting_Started_as_a_Wikipedia_Editor][section 6]].

Finally, if you have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out to me (Pablo). My email is my first name followed by ~@~ followed by ~tlon.team~.
